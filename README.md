 # DataBase-Design: Building A Business Database
## Introduction
### A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval and management. It typically uses tables to store information, allowing users to easily query, update and analyze data. A database is like a digital filing cabinet. It stores information in an organized way, like different folders for various topics. Each folder(table) contains rows and columns where specific pieces of information(data) are kept. This makes it easy to find, manage and update information just like flipping through folders in a real filing cabinet.
