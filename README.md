 # DataBase-Design: Building A Business Database
## Introduction
### A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval and management. It typically uses tables to store information, allowing users to easily query, update and analyze data. A database is like a digital filing cabinet. It stores information in an organized way, like different folders for various topics. Each folder(table) contains rows and columns where specific pieces of information(data) are kept. This makes it easy to find, manage and update information just like flipping through folders in a real filing cabinet.
## Project Overview
### In this project, I designed a database from scratch to efficiently manage business operations and to meet the client's unique need. The objective of this project is to efficiently manage and organize vast amounts of data related to Customers, Employees, Orders, Categories, Products and suppliers. This aids in streamlining operations, improving data accuracy and facilitaating data-driven decision making for better business performance. 
### These Objectives were achieved by;
1. Database Creation
2. Table Creation
3. Normalization and Denormalization
4. Setting up Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
5. Populating tables, testing and validation
